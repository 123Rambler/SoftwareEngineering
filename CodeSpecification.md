# Indentation
  Use 4 spaces per indentation level
# Variable naming
  
  Global variable name: global_var_name; 
  
  Instance name: instance_var_name; 
  
  Local variable names: local_var_name. 
  
  Variable names should be descriptive. 
  
  Avoid abbreviations, especially those that are not clear to non-project people. 

# Maximum number of characters per line
  Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters
  
# Maximum number of function lines
  30 lines
  
# Function and class naming
  Function name: function_name; 
  
  Parameter name: function_parameter_name; 
  
  Function names should be descriptive. 
  
  ClassName: ClassName; 

# constant

  Global constant name: GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME; 
  
  Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words. 
  
  Examples include MAX_OVERFLOW and TOTAL.
  
# Blank line rule
  Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

  Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

  Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. 
  
  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

  Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
  
# Annotation rules
## Function Annotations
  Function annotations should use PEP 484 syntax 
  
## Variable Annotations
  Annotations for module level variables, class and instance variables, and local variables should have a single space after the colon.

  There should be no space before the colon.

  If an assignment has a right hand side, then the equality sign should have exactly one space on both sides
  
# Space before and after operator
  One space

# Other rules
  There would not be Chinese except comments and file name
